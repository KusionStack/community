# KusionStack Community Roles

This document describes the set of roles individuals may have within the KusionStack community.

## User

A ***user*** is someone that uses KusionStack. They contribute to KusionStack projects by providing feedback to developers in the form of bug reports and feature suggestions. Users participate in the KusionStack community by helping other users.

## Contributor

A ***contributor*** is a user who contributes to the project in the form of code or documentation. They take extra steps to participate in a project, are active on the community, participate in discussions, provide patches, documentation, suggestions, and criticism. 

## Committer

A ***committer*** is a developer that was given **write access** to the code repository. Not needing to depend on other people for the patches, they are actually making short-term decisions for the project. The PMC can (even tacitly) agree and approve it into permanency, or they can reject it. Remember that the PMC makes the decisions, not the individual committers.
